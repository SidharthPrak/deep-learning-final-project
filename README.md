Real-Time Emotion Recognition: Improving Social Interaction for Individuals on the Autism Spectrum

Problem Statement:
One of the many everyday hardships faced by
individuals afflicted with ASL or other
neuro-divergent disorders is the inability to pick
up on social cues or trouble engaging in regular
social interactions. This stems from their having
difficulty recognizing emotions in face and tone.
Our problem statement is to develop a model that
would gauge the other personâ€™s emotion in
real-time using a three-step classification process
analyzing facial expressions, tone of speech, and
language used in the interaction.

Model Description:
We use a CNN with a Bi-directional
LSTM for real-time facial expression recognition
along with speech emotion classification.
